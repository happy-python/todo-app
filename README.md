# todo-app

> We have learned how to initialize a Vue app using the Vue CLI. In addition, we learned about component structure, adding data to components, event listeners and event handlers. We saw how to create a todo, edit it and delete it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
